# Pascals Triangle

Pascal’s triangle, in algebra, a triangular arrangement of numbers that gives the coefficients
in the expansion of any binomial expression, such as (x + y)n.
It is named for the 17th-century French mathematician Blaise Pascal, but it is far older.

I created a Python program that implements Pascals Triangle by creating a function **def pascal_triangle(n):** that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of n:
It returns an empty list if n <= 0.
